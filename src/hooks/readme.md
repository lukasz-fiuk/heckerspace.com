# More Hooks!

This project utilizes hooks from [usehooks-ts](https://usehooks-ts.com/).

Feel free to write your own hooks, but please check if the library above doesn't already have one that you need.

## Docs

When creating new hooks, please remember to include an example usage for future reference.

Example:

```tsx
/*

### Usage ###

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [isModalOpen, setIsModalOpen] = useState(false);
  useDisableScroll(isModalOpen);

  ...
}

*/
```
